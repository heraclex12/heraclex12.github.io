      I'm currently a PhD student at <a class="underline-link" href="https://umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park (UMD)</a>, where my research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Translation. 
      Previously, I was a Senior ML Engineer at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.useblackbox.io/" target="_blank">BLACKBOX AI</a>, specializing in cutting-edge research on large language models and their applications in code generation.
      With over five years of hands-on experience, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table.
      I'm also a member of <a class="underline-link" href="https://vietai.org/" target="_blank">VietAI</a>, advised by <a class="uderline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bmbkv6sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Minh-Thang Luong</a>, where we focus on advancing artificial intelligence research in the Vietnamese community.

      I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or taking my cute pets for a walk.
